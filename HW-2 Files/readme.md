This week was a very relaxing entry into JavaScript, and I actually enjoyed doing it.

My progress was pretty fast, and was free of any issues I could find. I follow a LOT of tech Youtube
channels, and  that was the vast majority of my websites. Games I play all over the place, but 
I stuck with my 3 faves. As for artists, I follow several on Facebook, and I highlighted a few I enjoy the most.

the one thing that took me the longest, was figuring out how to create multiple lines in the console.log, there may be less tedious ways to do it, but I am happy with what I used to do it.
