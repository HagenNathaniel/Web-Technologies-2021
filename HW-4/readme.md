This week was a continuation, in my eyes anyway, for last week's assignment. An assignment I thoroughly enjoyed doing, to be perfectly honest.

I had a few issues along the way, for some reason, even though I used the Insstructor's example, an undeclared variable error was my biggest hurdle. I spent a lot of time comparing how I wrote my code to his, and couldn't figure it out. I eventually did, but still don't know why it didn't work the first time I did it.
