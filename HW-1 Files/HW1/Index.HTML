    <h1>
        Information about Nathaniel</h1>
<p>
    Nathaniel is a Computer Scientist, a PC Builder, Esports Athlete, Gamer, Website designer, Amateur Programmer, PC hardware enthusiast, and owner of a Stubborn, bossy Corgi!
     He also is a freelance/independant Game developer, utilizing the Game Engine <i>Unreal Engine</i>!!
     Beginning his college career in Spring of 2014, he has been going nonstop ever since. Being awarded an impressive 3 degrees along the way, including a Associate of Applied Science in
     Information Technology, a General AA Degree in preparation of a bachelor's in Fine Arts degree, with a focus on Interactive Media and Game development, as well as the BFA itself. During 
     this time, he has been on the Dean's (3.4 or better GPA) list an impressive 5 times!
</p>
<p>
    In his professional life, he has been a Food Service employee at Hamilton, Montana's McDonald's restaurant since March of 2005, and became a Crew Trainer and Production Area Lead in early
    2020, after the restaurant was brought under a new ownership and General Management team. Prior to that, he was an electrician's apprentice for several years, and later a "go to" and 
    cleaning crew for the Stock Farm, located outside Hamilton. Also, during his 16 years of loyal service to McDonald's, he took a month long approved break, and interned at Darby School District's 
    k-12 Campus. Following that, he returned to McDonald's, and found he was deeply missed by his friends at the store.
</p>
<p> 
    His inspiration to become a game developer came from his lifelong love of games, and the rapidly evolving technology associated with them, both in terms of graphics and storytelling. 
    While his programming skills are not expert level, he has learned other ways to implement his knowledge and interests in game development, while learning to use one of the most popular game
    engines in the world, Epic Game's <i><b>Unreal Engine 4</b></i>,and is currently working on an ongoing project in the Engine, which has taught him how to implement motion, AI, and other features into 
    his ever expanding knowledge base.

            <p>
                A very good reason to choose him, is he's very dedicated to the task he is given. And will put his heart and soul into the job, especially if he is interested in the task given.

                "Every Job is an opportunity to learn something new" is one of his favorite sayings. And it applies to everything he puts his mind to, regardless of difficulty level.
