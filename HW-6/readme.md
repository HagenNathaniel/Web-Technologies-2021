This week was all about adding to our previous game project, this time with JSON!!

I had some difficulty trying to get the HW6 example video code to work with my previous files, due to a 'undefined' error I could NOT for the life of me fix, or find why it didn't work.
This also included a 'dry run' attempt.

I eventually had to modify example code, to use my own css files, as well as image files. I also tried to write the code that was missing from MY code, from the working example code, but that didn't work either.

I also wanted to center the assets, but was only able to center it to the top center of the screen.

all in all, I love how things turned out, minus a few glaring and minor formatting issues.
