This week was fun!

I enjoyed getting something to work without THAT much help (there's a few issues still, but I plan to fix them at a later time, I understand MOST of the concepts at this point).

Most of the issues I had pertained to incorrect references in my JS code. The only issues left are that I haven't had much time to has out SOME of the rest of the story, and the other is that the game quits when it shouldn't at times.

As stated before, I plan to fix them as soon as I have a bit of time.
