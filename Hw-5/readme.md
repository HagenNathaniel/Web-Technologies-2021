This sweek was the beginning of our matching game project.

I was fully able to write it all myself, which made me very proud, as I was able to do for the last few assignments.

I ended up having an issue where I was having file navigation and retrieval problems, which were causing my css and image files to not work correctly, but thanks to Professor Cassens, I got that sorted out, and was able to fix it to work as originally intended.

Look forward to continuing this project further next week!
